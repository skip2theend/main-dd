          <h2>Kevin Powell Made Me Write A Blog</h2>
          <p>First things first, the titel is very tongue in cheek! But kind of true. I've been watching Kevin powell's YouTube channel, taken part on some of his courses and he's been an integral part of my reburth back into a web development career.</p>
          <p>Kevin's mentioned it multiple times and I finally decided to take his advice. In his General Musings Podcast Episode <a href="https://youtu.be/rsILgWh5WiE?si=xhmibZYGLvOvrQtb">How teaching helped me become a better developer</a> he talks about teaching and getting your code out there. In particular in his <a href="https://youtu.be/rsILgWh5WiE?si=CICDkT4K5-8QhYlY&t=607">conclusion</a> he talks about the benefits of explaing things.</p>
          <p>So I put down my tutorials, courses and part projects and made this blog my focus project. How it will form, how I will use it, what I will write and what about, at this point I don't know. But I will.</p>
          <p>There's lots of other great people out there, who have also mentioned this same approach and the importance of getting your code out there publicly. Watching/reading/listening to any of these incredible people is always worthwhile and I do it regularly.</p>
